📊 PhonePe Transaction Insights Dashboard
🚀 Domain: Finance / Digital Payments
💡 Tech Stack: Python | SQL | Streamlit | Plotly | Pandas | MySQL | GeoJSON
🧩 Project Overview

The PhonePe Transaction Insights Dashboard is a data analytics project designed to analyze India's digital payment landscape using PhonePe Pulse data.
It provides interactive visualizations, geographical insights, and business case studies to help understand transaction patterns, user engagement, and insurance growth across Indian states and districts.

Built with Streamlit, it connects to a MySQL database containing cleaned and structured PhonePe transaction data extracted from JSON files.

🎯 Project Objectives

Analyze transaction trends by state, quarter, and payment category
Study user growth and device engagement patterns
Evaluate insurance penetration and transaction volume
Identify top-performing regions for market expansion
Present insights via an interactive Streamlit dashboard
